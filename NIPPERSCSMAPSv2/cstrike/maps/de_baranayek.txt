Once again the CTs find themselves 
trapped in some foreign land protecting 
some little green boxes.  The “great 
boxes of mystery and intrigue” are 
believed to contain pieces of the gwned 
babies’ souls.   These are truly amazing 
artifacts and they must be protected 
at all costs!

T:  Blow up one of the green boxes.

CT:  Prevent the great boxes of 
mystery and intrigue from being 
blown up.
