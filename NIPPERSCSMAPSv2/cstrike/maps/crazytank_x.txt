An old abandoned bunker and mining facility 
has become the target of terrorists and 
counter-terrorists.  Both teams only 
know that this place holds the key to something 
very important… but they don’t know exactly what.  
Something was buried deep within the mines.  
Something worth dieing for.  Something worth 
bringing out the most deadly weapons available.  

T:  Rush the bunker and plant the bomb.

CT:  Protect this sacred ground at all costs.
