“Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom”

  CTs:  Find the two hostages in the 
mines and bring them across the bridge.  
If the bridge is out you can rescue 
the hostages by bringing them down below
the bridge.

  Ts: Just stop the CTs from rescuing the 
hostages.  


NOTES: 
-You need to be a short distance away
from the levers when you hit ‘use’.

-When the spikes are activated in the spike
room the only way to get out is to have a 
teammate open the door by hitting the switch 
on the outside.

-I am well aware of the many inaccuracies that 
fill this map with shame.
