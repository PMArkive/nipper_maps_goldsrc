The evil terrorists are at it again.  
They are trying to steal Christmas 
from a ski-lodge.  I hope the CTs 
can stop them, don’t you?  Well I guess 
you wouldn’t if you were playing on 
the T team, in that case you would want 
the Ts to succeed.  Anyway…. I have no 
clue what to write for this stupid 
text file.  Nobody reads these anyway 
so I guess I’ll just stop my ramblings 
before I end up with a 5 meg text file.

Merry freakin’ X-mas ya bastards!

CT:  Protect the two bombsites.

T:   Blow up one of the bombsites.
