Isengard Battle - Bomb
Mapping  by Nathaniel Miller AKA NIPPER
maps @ www.geocities.com/nipper14223

Saruman has destroyed most of the Ent’s 
forest and they have become ever so pissed.  

Ts:  Take control of an Ent or ride on one’s 
shoulders and attack Saruman’s tower.

CTs:  Defend the tower from the Ent assault.

NOTES:  
-The bomb can be planted on the tower’s ramp.  
-I am well aware of the many inaccuracies that 
fill this map with shame.
