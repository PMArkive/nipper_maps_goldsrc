In order to prevent the creation of the
terminators and to stop judgment day
from happening the Ts have gone back
in time to blow up the Cyberdyne building.

CTs hurry inside and stop the Ts from 
planting the bomb.

NOTE: The door to the bombsite near the T
spawn has a 14 second delay before it will 
be blown open.  It is triggered by walking 
up to it.
