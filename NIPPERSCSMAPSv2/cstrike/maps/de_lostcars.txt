I have found with much research that there 
is an overlying world that humans cannot 
see which contains EVERY func_vehicle 
that has ever been lost. This map portrays 
only a small section of the "temple of 
lost cars" that is located in this 6th 
dimension.

CT: Protect the crazytank and the golf cart.

T:  Plant the bomb you idiot!
