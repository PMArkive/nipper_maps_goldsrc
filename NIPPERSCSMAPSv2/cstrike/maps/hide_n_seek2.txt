A local resident of a quiet suburban 
neighborhood has just called the police 
after seeing “several armed burglars” in 
their backyard.  A police officer was 
dispatched to the vicinity of the report 
but immediately began taking fire and 
had to withdraw.  So the decision was 
made to go tactical.  

CT:  Find the Ts and eliminate them 
before time runs out!

T:  Hide and / or kill all the CTs.
