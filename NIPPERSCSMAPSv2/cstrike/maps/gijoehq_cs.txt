A few weeks ago a small GI Joe HQ was 
raided and taken over by Cobra.  We 
believe they are holding the commander
of that HQ hostage in its own jail cell.

CTs with the cover of their chopper must  
enter the base and rescue the hostage.

Ts defend your base and don't let the 
CTs get that hostage!

YO JOE!
