A group of terrorists have stolen the 
CT’s treasure map.  They have found the 
island where the CT’s treasure is hidden 
and plan to blow it up.  The CTs have 
already begun to dig up one of their 
treasure chests, however it is not too 
late to blow it up.

T:  Travel inland and blow up one of the 
two CT treasure stashes.  

CT:  Prevent the Ts from destroying 
your loot.
