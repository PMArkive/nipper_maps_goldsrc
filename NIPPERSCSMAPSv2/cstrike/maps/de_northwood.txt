The Ts have discovered yet another CT 
hideout along a vacant road.  They have 
made their usual plans to destroy it.  
But if they can’t manage that then they 
will at least make it as uninhabitable as 
possible by either taking out half of their 
water supply or their power generator.  

CT:  Protect your highway shantytown.

T:  Blow up either the water tower or 
the green generator.
