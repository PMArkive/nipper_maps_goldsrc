After hearing of a terrorist plot to 
capture Santa’s workshop the CTs were 
deployed to the North Pole to help protect 
the workshop.


CTs:  Protect the Crazytank, for it is 
your most powerful weapon. 

Ts:  Attack the CT defenses, especially 
the Crazytank.  Once the tank is disabled 
the CTs will fall and the workshop will 
be yours!


NOTES:   The Ts have a radio that they can 
use once every 35 seconds to call in an air 
strike against the CTs stronghold.  But your 
radio can be heard by the CTs so they will 
know its coming!
