One day two twin evil big-head babies 
were hungry.  So they decided to order 
a pizza, but they couldn’t order a regular 
pizza because their enormous brains need 
giant pizza.  So they called upon the great 
fast-talking rap-gods and asked them for a 
giant super-pizza.  The gods agreed to give 
them a giant super-pizza and they left it 
on the “shrine of the fast-talking rap-gods”.
So the evil big-head babies went out to 
pick up the pizza but while they were gone 
a group of terrorists broke into their house.

CT:  Lead the evil big-head babies back 
to their house while you protect the 
giant pizza from the Ts.

T:  Prevent the evil big-head babies 
from getting home or blow up their 
giant pizza.
