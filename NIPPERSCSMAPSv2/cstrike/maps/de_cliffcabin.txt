After a long year of crate prefab 
defending, the CTs decided to take 
a vacation in their secret abandoned 
cabin.  The Ts managed to place a 
tracking bug underneath one of the CTs 
cars and have used it to locate the CT 
secret hide out.  

CT:  Defend your hide out from the 
terrorist attack.

T:  Plant the bomb either in the house, 
or on the walkway behind the house.
