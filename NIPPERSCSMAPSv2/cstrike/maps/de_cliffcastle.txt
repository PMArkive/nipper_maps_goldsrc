The CTs are struggling to help keep 
their ancient castle from falling victim 
to the effects of erosion.  The cliff 
that the castle rests on has become 
very weak and the slightest explosion 
will send it into the water below.  The 
Ts know this and have planned their attack.

CT:  Protect the two bombsites.  One 
is at the sprouting tree or “heart 
of the castle” and the other is at 
the bottom of the stairwell.

T:   Blow up one of the bombsites 
thus plunging the CT castle into 
the water.
