 Those crazy Ts are after some crates again. 
But it is believed that these crates have 
magical powers and once the ancient crates 
are set atop the ancient pillars they create 
and ancient rift in the ancient space-time-
continuum.  This rift creates magical water 
that gives ever-lasting life, thus the aqueduct 
part.  So the Ts think that if they can 
successfully detonate a bomb near the pillars 
with those crates on them, it will create a 
black hole that sucks in all CTs and crate 
prefabs that are associated in any way with 
the CTs and/or CT affiliates and well-wishers 
of the CTs (well-wishers including those who 
don’t wish the CTs any specific harm).  

CT:  Stop the Ts from making you get sucked 
into a black hole.

T:  Plant the god damn bomb you stupid moron.
