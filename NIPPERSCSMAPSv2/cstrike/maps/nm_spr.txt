Yet another d-day map!  Hurray!

CTs:  Ride to the beach, grab some guns, 
activate the bangalores by breaking the 
fuse, rush up the beach with the 
engineers and bring them to the artillery 
at the top of the beach so they can blow 
it up.

Ts:  Sit there and shoot at the CTs.

NOTE: the boats might be messed up for 
the first round.
