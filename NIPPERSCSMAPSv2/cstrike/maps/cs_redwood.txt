A batch of terrorists has taken over 
a small home in a forest.  The CTs 
really don’t like it when the Ts take 
over other people’s homes.  The CTs are 
planning to bust in to that house, 
rescue the hostages, and kill the Ts.

NOTES:  There are two hostages in the house.  
The rescue zone is the APC by the CT spawn.
