A grand hotel has fallen under attack by 
those evil terrorists.  But this is a five 
star hotel and we plan to keep it that way.  
So the CTs are going to rescue some people 
and save the hotel.  Yay!

CT:  Go rescue the god damn hostages.  
Stop being a bitch and rescue them already.  

T:  Kill those CTs.
