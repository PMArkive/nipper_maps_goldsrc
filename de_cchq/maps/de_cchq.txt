Thanks to Stealth_Assassin for help with 
the statues.

The evil terrorists have located the slightly 
less evil Cherryclan HQ.  They are planning on 
taking it down by destroying the control room 
or the CS servers.

CT: Defend the base at all costs.  Try using 
the bunkers and trenches for very good time yes?

T: Attack the base by using the vehicles or 
just walk.  The important thing is that you 
get inside and plant the bomb.
